# Fox
Fox is a tool that wraps Evan's ``focstest.py`` and the FoCS autograder email interface to provide a simple interface for checking answers and submitting homework assignments. 


If you're having trouble installing OCaml, or experiencing difficulty with setting up and running focstest, you'll may find this particularly useful.
