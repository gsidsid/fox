# Fox
Fox is a tool that wraps Evan's ``focstest.py`` and the FoCS autograder email interface to provide a simple interface for checking answers and submitting homework assignments. 


If you're having trouble installing OCaml, or experiencing difficulty with setting up and running focstest, Fox will let you just focus on getting the assignment done in the fastest way possible.
